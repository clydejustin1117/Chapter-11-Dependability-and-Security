            All of us are familiar with the problem of computer system failure. For no obvious reason, our computers sometimes crash or go wrong in some way. Programs running
            on these computers may not operate as expected and occasionally may corrupt the
            data that is managed by the system. We have learned to live with these failures but
            few of us completely trust the personal computers that we normally use It is not meaningful to express dependability numerically.

            The dependability of a computer system is a property of the system that reflects its trustworthiness. Trustworthiness here essentially means the degree of confidence
            a user has that the system will operate as they expect, and that the system will not ‘fail’ in normal use. It is not meaningful to express dependability numerically.

    <p> Rather, we use relative terms such as ‘not dependable,’ ‘very dependable,’ and
‘ultra-dependable’ to reflect the degrees of trust that we might have in a system.
Trustworthiness and usefulness are not, of course, the same thing.</p>
    <p> I don’t think
that the word processor that I used to write this book is a very dependable system.
It sometimes freezes and has to be restarted. Nevertheless, because it is very useful,
I am prepared to tolerate occasional failure.</p>
    <p> However, to reflect my lack of trust in
the system I save my work frequently and keep multiple backup copies of it. I compensate for the lack of system dependability by actions that limit the damage that
could result from system failure</p>
   </article>

<p> There are four principal dimensions to dependability, as shown in Figure 11.1.</p>
<ol>

<li> Availability Informally, the availability of a system is the probability that it will
be up and running and able to deliver useful services to users at any given time.</li>
<li> Reliability Informally, the reliability of a system is the probability, over a given
period of time, that the system will correctly deliver services as expected by
the user.
</li>
<li> Safety Informally, the safety of a system is a judgment of how likely it is that the
system will cause damage to people or its environment.</li>
<li> Security Informally, the security of a system is a judgment of how likely it is that
the system can resist accidental or deliberate intrusions.</li>

</ol>

<section>

<p> The dependability properties shown in Figure 11.1 are complex properties that
can be broken down into a number of other, simpler properties. For example, security includes ‘integrity’ (ensuring that the systems program and data are not
damaged) and ‘confidentiality’ (ensuring that information can only be accessed by
people who are authorized). Reliability includes ‘correctness’ (ensuring the system
services are as specified), ‘precision’ (ensuring information is delivered at an appropriate level of detail), and ‘timeliness’ (ensuring that information is delivered when
it is required).</p>

</section>

<section>
    <p> Of course, these dependability properties are not all applicable to all systems. For
the insulin pump system, introduced in Chapter 1, the most important properties are
availability (it must work when required), reliability (it must deliver the correct dose
of insulin), and safety (it must never deliver a dangerous dose of insulin). Security is
not an issue as the pump will not maintain confidential information. It is not networked and so cannot be maliciously attacked. For the wilderness weather system,
availability and reliability are the most important properties because the costs of
repair may be very high. For the patient information system, security is particularly
important because of the sensitive private data that is maintained.</p>

<p>As well as these four main dependability properties, you may also think of other
system properties as dependability properties:</p>
<ol>
    <article>
    <li>
        Repairability System failures are inevitable, but the disruption caused by failure
can be minimized if the system can be repaired quickly. For that to happen, it
must be possible to diagnose the problem, access the component that has failed,
and make changes to fix that component. Repairability in software is enhanced
when the organization using the system has access to the source code and has
the skills to make changes to it. Open source software makes this easier but the
reuse of components can make it more difficult.


    </li>
    Maintainability As systems are used, new requirements emerge and it is important to maintain the usefulness of a system by changing it to accommodate these
new requirements. Maintainable software is software that can be adapted economically to cope with new requirements, and where there is a low probability
that making changes will introduce new errors into the system.

     <li>
        Survivability A very important attribute for Internet-based systems is survivability
(Ellison et al., 1999b). Survivability is the ability of a system to continue to
deliver service whilst under attack and, potentially, whilst part of the system is
disabled. Work on survivability focuses on identifying key system components
and ensuring that they can deliver a minimal service. Three strategies are used to
enhance survivability—resistance to attack, attack recognition, and recovery
from the damage caused by an attack (Ellison et al., 1999a; Ellison et al., 2002).
I discuss this in more detail in Chapter 14.
        
    </li>

     <li>
         Error tolerance This property can be considered as part of usability and reflects
the extent to which the system has been designed so that user input errors are
avoided and tolerated. When user errors occur, the system should, as far as possible, detect these errors and either fix them automatically or request the user to
reinput their data.
    </li>

</ol>

<section>
    <p> The notion of system dependability as an encompassing property was introduced
because the dependability properties of availability, security, reliability, and safety are
closely related. Safe system operation usually depends on the system being available
and operating reliably. A system may become unreliable because an intruder has corrupted its data. Denial of service attacks on a system are intended to compromise the system’s availability. If a system is infected with a virus, you cannot then be confident
in its reliability or safety because the virus may change its behavior.</p>

<p> To develop dependable software, you therefore need to ensure that: </p>

<article>
    <ol>

        <li>
            You avoid the introduction of accidental errors into the system during software
specification and development
        </li>
        <li>You design verification and validation processes that are effective in discovering
residual errors that affect the dependability of the system.</li>
<li>  You design protection mechanisms that guard against external attacks that can
compromise the availability or security of the system.</li>
<li> You configure the deployed system and its supporting software correctly for its
operating environment.</li> 

    </ol>
</article>

<article>
    <p>In addition, you should usually assume that your software is not perfect and
that software failures may occur. Your system should therefore include recovery
mechanisms that make it possible to restore normal system service as quickly as
possible.
The need for fault tolerance means that dependable systems have to include
redundant code to help them monitor themselves, detect erroneous states, and
recover from faults before failures occur. This affects the performance of systems, as
additional checking is required each time the system executes. Therefore, designers
usually have to trade off performance and dependability. You may need to leave
checks out of the system because these slow the system down. However, the consequential risk here is that some failures occur because a fault has not been detected.
Because of extra design, implementation, and validation costs, increasing the
dependability of a system significantly increases development costs. In particular,
validation costs are high for systems that must be ultra-dependable such as safetycritical control systems. As well as validating that the system meets its requirements,
the validation process may have to prove to an external regulator that the system is
safe. For example, aircraft systems have to demonstrate to regulators, such as the
Federal Aviation Authority, that the probability of a catastrophic system failure that
affects aircraft safety is extremely low.
Figure 11.2 shows that the relationship between costs and incremental improvements in dependability. If your software is not very dependable, you can get significant improvements at relatively low costs by using better software engineering.
However, if you are already using good practice, the costs of improvement are much
greater and the benefits from that improvement are less. There is also the problem of
testing your software to demonstrate that it is dependable. This relies on running
many tests and looking at the number of failures that occur. As your software
becomes more dependable, you see fewer and fewer failures. Consequently, more
and more tests are needed to try and assess how many problems remain in the
software. As testing is very expensive, this dramatically increases the cost of
high-dependability systems.</p>
