            <p>The objective of this chapter is to introduce software dependability and security. When you have read this chapter, you will:</p>
            <div class="inside-text">
            <p>understand why dependability  and security are usually more important than the functional characteristics of a software system;</p>
            <p>understand the four principal dimensions of dependability, namely availability, reliability, safety, and security;</p>
            <p>be aware of the specialized terminology that is used when discussing security and dependability;</p>
            <p>understand that to achieve secure, dependable software, you need to avoid mistakes during the development of a system, to detect and remove errors when the system is in use, and to limit the damage caused by operational failures.</p>
