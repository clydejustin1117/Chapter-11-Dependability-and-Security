            <h4>Objectives.</h4>
            <p>The objective of this chapter is to introduce software dependability and security. When you have read this chapter, you will:</p>
            <li>
            <p>understand why dependability and security are usually more important than the functional characteristics of a software system;</p>
            <p>understand the four principal dimensions of dependability, namely availability, reliability, safety, and security;</p>
            <p>be aware of the specialized terminology that is used when discussing security and dependability;</p>
            <p>understand that to achieve secure, dependable software, you need to avoid mistakes during the development of a system, to detect and remove errors when the system is in use, and to limit the damage caused by operational failures.</p>
            </li>

            <p>As computer systems have become deeply embedded in our business and personal lives, the problems that result from system and software failure are increasing. A failure of server software in an e-commerce company could lead to a major loss of revenue, and possibly also customers for that company. A software error in an embedded control system in a car could lead to expensive recalls of that model for repair and, in the worst case, could be a contributory factor in accidents. The infection of company PCs with malware requires expensive cleanup operations to sort out the problem and could result in the loss or damage to sensitive information.</p>
            <p>Because software-intensive systems are so important to governments, companies,and individuals, it is essential that widely used software is trustworthy. The software should be available when required and should operate correctly and without undesirable side effects, such as unauthorized information disclosure. The term ‘dependability’ was proposed by Laprie (1995) to cover the related systems attributes of availability, reliability, safety, and security. As I discuss in Section 11.1, these properties are inextricably linked, so having a single term to cover them all makes sense</p>
            
            <article>
                <p>The dependability of systems is now usually more important than their detailed functionality for the following reasons:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li> System failures affect a large number of people. Many systems include functionality that is rarely used. If this functionality were left out of the system, only a small number of users would be affected. System failures, which affect the availability of a system, potentially affect all users of the system. Failure may mean that normal business is impossible.</li>
                    <li>Users often reject systems that are unreliable, unsafe, or insecure. If users find that a system is unreliable or insecure, they will refuse to use it. Furthermore, they may also refuse to buy or use other products from the same company that produced the unreliable system, because they believe that these products are also likely to be unreliable or insecure.</li>
                    <li>System failure costs may be enormous. For some applications, such as a reactor control system or an aircraft navigation system, the cost of system failure is orders of magnitude greater than the cost of the control system.</li>
                    <li>Undependable systems may cause information loss. Data is very expensive to collect and maintain; it is usually worth much more than the computer system on which it is processed. The cost of recovering lost or corrupt data is usually very high.</li>
                </ol>
            </article>

            <article>
                <p>As I discussed in Chapter 10, software is always part of a broader system. It executes in an operational environment that includes the hardware on which the software executes, the human users of that software, and the organizational or business processes where the software is used. When designing a dependable system, you therefore have to consider:</p>
                <ol>
                    
                    <li>Hardware failure System hardware may fail because of mistakes in its design, because components fail as a result of manufacturing errors, or because the components have reached the end of their natural life.</li>
                    <h4>Critical systems</h4>
                    <p>Some classes of system are ‘critical systems’ where system failure may result in injury to people, damage to the environment, or extensive economic losses. Examples of critical systems include embedded systems in medical devices, such as an insulin pump (safety-critical), spacecraft navigation systems (mission-critical), and online money transfer systems (business critical).</p>
                    <p>Critical systems are very expensive to develop. Not only must they be developed so that failures are very rare but they must also include recovery mechanisms that are used if and when failures occur</p>
                    <h5>http://www.SoftwareEngineering-9.com/Web/Dependability/CritSys.html</h5>
                    <li>Software failure System software may fail because of mistakes in its specification, design, or implementation.</li>
                    <li>Operational failure Human users may fail to use or operate the system correctly. As hardware and software have become more reliable, failures in operation are now, perhaps, the largest single cause of system failures.</li>
                </ol>
            </article>
            
            <p>These failures are often interrelated. A failed hardware component may mean. This puts them under stress and people under stress often make mistakes. This can cause the software to fail, which means more work for the operators, even more stress, and so on.</p>
            <p>As a result, it is particularly important that designers of dependable, software-intensive systems take a holistic systems perspective, rather than focus on a single aspect of the system such as its software or hardware. If hardware, software, and operational processes are designed separately, without taking into account the potential weaknesses of other parts of the system, then it is more likely that errors will occur at the interfaces between the different parts of the system.</p>
